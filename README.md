5minbootstrap
=============

Bootstrap and secure your server in 5 minutes flat using Ansible on another Unix box you control, referred to as "yourmachine". On a minimal Debian install, you might have to run first  
	yourmachine$ apt-get update && apt-get install git ansible nano sshpass

A riff on these excellent posts:

TL;DR
=====

## Step 1: Set the root password

Run:

    yourmachine$ ssh root@server

Enter the initial root password from your hosting provider, then run:

	root@server# passwd
	root@server# apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
  

## Step 2: Fetch the bootstrap recipe

[https://github.com/ibonobo/5minbootstrap/](https://github.com/ibonobo/5minbootstrap/)

    yourmachine ~$ git clone https://github.com/ibonobo/5minbootstrap.git
	yourmachine ~$ cd 5minbootstrap


## Step 3: Edit hosts.ini

Ansible needs to know about the servers you want to manage.  There is
no fancy central database, just a text file with a list of
servers.  Oh, it's called an "inventory file."

Edit the `hosts.ini` that came with the repository.  Replace
`127.0.0.1` with your IP address, and `:2222` with your SSH port.

    [newservers]
	127.0.0.1:2222
	

## Step 4: Update the SSH public key.

    yourmachine ~/5minbootstrap$ cp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub ./ibonobo.pub

For simplicity I provided my public key in the repo.  Unless you want
to grant me login access to your server, you probably want to change
that. :-)


## Step 5: Modify the playbook variables.

You don't want the original author to get your logs, so modify the email accordingly as well as the password > bootstrap.yml
also, lines 44-45, if Ubuntu it deletes stable (so that only security remain) but if Debian it should be also security only so modify to remove the rest or comment out 44-45  
//      "o=Debian,a=stable";  
//      "o=Debian,a=stable-updates";  
//      "o=Debian,a=proposed-updates";  
        "origin=Debian,archive=stable,label=Debian-Security";  


## Step 6: Run the playbook

If you are logging into a fresh Linode, or another system where you only have the `root` user, you need to run this command:

    yourmachine ~/5minbootstrap$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini bootstrap.yml --user root --ask-pass
(otherwise, on Vagrant, --ask-pass --sudo after .yml)

IB note: On a minimal Debian install I get this error.  
"Using a SSH password instead of a key is not possible because Host Key checking is enabled and sshpass does not support this.  Please add this host's fingerprint to your known_hosts file to manage this host."  
To get key:  
$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa server_ip >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
That finally got the ball rolling, but the it hang at update, so when first logging in and changing password, an update+upg may be necessary.
	
## Step 7: Go get a cup of coffee because you're DONE.

I prefer hand-ground French pressed coffee myself.  Tea is also fine.


IB TO DO:  
  
1. ADD / modify port + 45-44  
  
2. If you want logging, or more info, pass the -v flag to ansible-playbook on the command line and you'll see the stdout and stderr for each task executed:  
	$ ansible-playbook -v playbook.yaml  
Ansible also has built-in support for logging. Add the following lines to your ansible configuration file:  
	[defaults]  
	log_path=/path/to/logfile  
Ansible will look in several places for the config file:  
	1. ansible.cfg in the current directory where you ran ansible-playbook  
	2. ~/.ansible.cfg  
	3. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg  
  
3. Some servers have the time zone off, which messes up the logs. To change the timezone interactively, do  
	$ dpkg-reconfigure tzdata  
to do it non-interactively (scripted), use in ansible  
	$ echo "US/Eastern" > /etc/timezone && dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive tzdata
